This guide will help you start building/modifying your EVM frontend with TAC SDK. You'll learn how to set up the SDK and make your first cross-chain transaction that will trigger your solidity code deployed on TAC.

## Installation

Install the TAC SDK using npm:

```bash
npm install tac-sdk
```


## Basic Setup
Once you've installed the SDK, you can start building. Here's a basic setup to get you started:

<Steps>
<Step title="Import dependencies">

```javascript
import { TacSdk } from "tac-sdk";
import { TonConnectUI } from "@tonconnect/ui";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize TON Connect">

```javascript
const tonConnectUI = new TonConnectUI({
    manifestUrl: "YOUR_MANIFEST_URL"
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create a TAC SDK instance">

```javascript
const tacSdk = new TacSdk({
    network: "TESTNET" // Use "MAINNET" for production
});
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Making Your First Cross-Chain Transaction

Here's a simple example of making a cross-chain transaction:

```javascript
// 1. Encode your parameters using ethers
const abi = new ethers.AbiCoder();
const encodedParameters = abi.encode(
    ['address', 'uint256'],
    [targetAddress, amount]
);

// 2. Set up transaction parameters
const params = {
    fromAddress: "YOUR_TON_ADDRESS",
    jettonAmount: 100,
    proxyMsg: {
        evmTargetAddress: "EVM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
        methodName: 'transfer(address,uint256)',
        encodedParameters: encodedParameters,
    },
    tokenAddress: "TON_TOKEN_ADDRESS",
    tonConnect: tonConnectUI
};

// 3. Send the transaction
await tacSdk.sendJettonWithProxyMsg(params);
    ```


## API Endpoints

You can use these public endpoints for development:

- Mainnet: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
- Testnet: https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC

## Next Steps

Now that you've made your first cross-chain transaction, you can:
