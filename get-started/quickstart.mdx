This guide will help you deploying your first TON dapp on TAC. There are 2 different components to take care of:
  - [Onchain components](/get-started/quickstart-onchain) (Solidity code) - Deployed on TAC EVM Extension network
  - [Frontend](/get-started/quickstart-frontend) (or Telegram MiniApp - TMA) - that works with TON/TVM wallets and manages TON transactions linked to the Solidity Code you target on TAC EVM
