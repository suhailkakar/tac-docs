TON App Chain (TAC) connects TON with EVM-compatible applications, creating a unified experience for users and developers. With TAC, you can interact with any EVM application using your TON wallet - removing the complexity of managing multiple wallets or using external bridges.

### What makes TAC unique?

- **Native TON Experience:** Access EVM applications straight from your TON wallet with the familiarity and security you trust
- **Proxy Apps:** Smart contracts automatically generated on both TON and EVM networks enable direct communication with EVM applications  
- **Security First:** Multiple validator groups working in parallel provide strong consensus and protect user transactions
- **Simple Integration:** Move your EVM applications to TON without rewriting code or learning new frameworks
