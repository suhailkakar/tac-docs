The decentralized components that are involved in the TAC architecture are 2:
  1. TAC EVM: a dPoS Layer1 EVM Chain built on CosmosSDK with Ethermint
  2. TAC Message Bridge: a decentralized message bridge to connect the TON network and the TAC EVM network

Community members can contribute to the security of this network in several ways:
  1. Running a TAC EVM Node will let community members to verify blocks secured by TAC EVM Validators and Babylon Bitcoin Staking. You can learn how to [run a TAC EVM Node here](node-runner)
  2. Securing the TAC EVM Network with Bitcoin (re)staking. Refer to Babylon docs to participate and earn a yield on the staked Bitcoin
  3. Becoming a TAC EVM Network Validator. There are a limited number of seats for Validators, refer to [this page](validator-1) to become a TAC EVM Validator. You can also delegate TAC tokens to existing validators to earn a yield.
  4. Becoming a TAC Message Bridge Sequencer. There are a limited number of seats to become part of the sequencers, refer to [this page](validator-2) to join the sequencing and earn bridging fees from TON restaking.
